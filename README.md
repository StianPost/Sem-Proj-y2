To create an e-commerce website that has both customer-facing and admin sections. Both sections should be responsive and the website will be populated by a Strapi API supplied by Noroff.

## Brief

You are to build an e-commerce website. You can choose the theme of your website. It should follow the site architecture described below.

Design your website using your favourite tool. You will need to find a suitable logo. If you decide to create a logo yourself, do not spend too much time on it.

You must apply all that you have learned in your studies so far. The site must have a good user experience and UI design, following todayâ€™s trends and design patterns.

Build a frontend with home, product list, product detail and cart pages.

Build admin pages to create, update and delete products.

The website must be responsive on all devices.

Building a checkout and payment system is not a part of the project.

**You will create and deploy your own version of strapi to heroku**

This project was my semester project for my 2nd year on Noroff, it's a E-commerce website where you can search for and order watches.

## Description

Add a more detailed description of what your project entails and set out to do.

I was given the task to design and create an E-commerce website.
I used Figma for the design, in particular I wanted to use Glasmorphism as a theme, that proved to be a challenge though I did make it work.

In the brief we also needed to create an admin side where you could do a CRUD operation on the watces:
 - Create
 - Read
 - Update
 - Delete

I also added a cart using local storage where you could add several watches into your shopping cart.

To create an e-commerce website that has both customer-facing and admin sections. Both sections should be responsive and the website will be populated by a Strapi API supplied by Noroff.

## Brief

You are to build an e-commerce website. You can choose the theme of your website. It should follow the site architecture described below.

Design your website using your favourite tool. You will need to find a suitable logo. If you decide to create a logo yourself, do not spend too much time on it.

You must apply all that you have learned in your studies so far. The site must have a good user experience and UI design, following todayâ€™s trends and design patterns.

Build a frontend with home, product list, product detail and cart pages.

Build admin pages to create, update and delete products.

The website must be responsive on all devices.

Building a checkout and payment system is not a part of the project.

**You will create and deploy your own version of strapi to heroku**
